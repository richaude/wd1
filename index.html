                    This page is meant to give an overview about the genre <i>vaporwave</i>. It's main form is that of music, but it comes along with some very special visual <b>aesthetics</b>, as well as with an often very ironic or cynic approach to <b>consumerism</b> and <b>late capitalist culture</b>.

                        In this article, I will shortly mention and introduce the most important <i>vaporwave</i> works and artists.

                            Macintosh Plus
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            Macintosh Plus can be seen as one of the most influential artists of the genre.
                            Her 2011 album <i>Floral Shoppe</i> is the album that introduced <i>vaporwave</i> to a broader audience. I'd be careful to call it a <b>mainstream</b> audience, as <i>vaporwave</i> is still some sort of a <em>niche</em> genre.

                                There is one song on <i>Floral Shoppe</i> called <i lang="ja">リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー </i> ("Lisa Frank 420 / Modern Computing"). It is the most recognized/memorized iconic song of the genre.

                            Now here is one important thing about <i>vaporwave</i>: It is a mainly sample-based genre.
                            This means, it's relying on other artists, mostly from the late 70s/80s/early 90s. Small excerpts of the original songs are taken and rearranged to new melodies, with a slow-down of tempo and pitch. Just imagine an old video or audio tape, that is played at a slower pace than usual - the tones get deeper as well.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In <i lang="ja">リサフランク420 / 現代のコンピュー </i>, the samples come from the 1984 Diana Ross cover of the song <i>It's your move</i>, originally sung by Doug Parkinson in 1983.

                            Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            This 2010 album is an interesting piece of art, because it was released even before the official beginning of the genre, but it resembles many criteria of <i>vaporwave</i>, like the slowing down of samples, connected to a strong feeling of nostalgia and melancholy. The name <i>Chuck Person</i> was a pseudonym of musician and artist <i>Daniel Lopatin</i>.

                        <p>
                            One should notice that the genre of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunderphonics">plunderphonics</a></i> has been there before.

                        <p>
                            This album is also considered one of the classics of the genre. It has a more ambient sound and resembles the feeling of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a></i>, like the impressions that you'd be in a dystopian futuristic megacity, for example <i>Tokyo</i> or <i>Seoul</i>, in the subway or on the streets.

            </p>
            <p>Michelle Lhooq of <i>Vice</i> called it

                    <li>chillwave for Marxists</li>
                    <li>post-elevator music</li>

            </p>
            <p>
                Music writer Miles Bowe calls it a fusion between
                <ul>
                    <li>Lopatin's "chopped and screwed plunderphonics"</li>
                    <li>"nihilistic easy-listening of James Ferraro’s Muzak-hellscapes"</li>

                Finally, I call it
                <ul>
                    <li>causing nostalgia about a time I've never consciously experienced</li>
                    <li>melancholic</li>
